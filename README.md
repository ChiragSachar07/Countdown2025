# Countdown2025
A simple web application that counts down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the start of the year 2025.

How it works:

HTML Structure: Defines the basic structure of the web page, including the container for the countdown display.
CSS Styling: Styles the appearance of the countdown display, making it visually appealing.
JavaScript Logic:
Calculates the time difference between the current time and the target date (January 1, 2025).
Extracts days, hours, minutes, and seconds from the time difference.
Updates the HTML element with the calculated time.
Schedules the update function to run every second.
To run the project:

Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/countdown-2025.git
Use code with caution.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Feel free to customize the design and functionality to your liking.
